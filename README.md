## How to run the project

Open a Terminal window and run
```
git clone https://github.com/mutawa/fend-project-7.git
```
Then wait for that to finish, and then move into the directory, then run the python http server command:

```
cd fend-project-7
python -m simpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Once that is done, you just need to open your browser and point it to `localhost:8000` by:

```
open "http://localhost:8000"
```
